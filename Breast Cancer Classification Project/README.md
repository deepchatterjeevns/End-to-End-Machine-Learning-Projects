## Introduction

This Web Application powered by <b>Machine Learning</b> and deployed using <b>Streamlit</b> focusses on various works on the <b>wisconsin dataset</b> starting from data source, cleaning, EDA and finally to creating a classification model that classifies whether a cancer is <b>benign or malignant</b>. The <b>accuracy of the model</b> is also checked using various methods and plots.

## Technology Used

<ul>
  <li>Streamlit</li>
  <li>Matplotlib</li>

## Installation

1. Drop a ⭐ on the Github Repository.
2. Download the repo as a zip file or clone it using the following command
```sh
https://github.com/pratik-276/End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Projects.git
```

3. Move inside the ` /Breast Cancer Classification Project ` folder and open CLI in that folder

4. Install the required libraries by the following command
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the following commands in the command line to get your streamlit app started
```sh
streamlit run main.py
```

6. After the previous step wait for some seconds, it will automatically open the deployed webpage on the browser.

7. Suggest if any improvements can be made or anything wrong. (an absolute necessary step)

## Conclusion

This is a try to present a much explored dataset in a complete deployed notebook form. Do drop a ⭐ if you like it. Also do check other projects in the same repository. I have two other projects so far. More coming soon.
